\begin{abstract}
In this digital  Technology age, we find ourselves performing tasks manually in the study room, which is not only time-consuming but also inconvenient. For instance, we must manually control the lights and fan using Bluetooth technology. However, our projects using RFID technology, offering automatic opening of the study room door and displaying when a person enters the room. Instantly, the lights and fan turn on, providing a seamless experience for anyone entering the study. Furthermore, with the integration of Bluetooth, individuals can utilize their smart devices to control the lights and fan, enhancing convenience. Our innovative project aims to streamline processes, saving significant time and eliminating hassle. Gone are the days of manual operation; everything within the studyroom, including the fan and lights, will be automated. Additionally, we address the issue of wastage by incorporating a PIR sensor to automatically turn off the washroom lights when no one is present, thereby reducing our electricity bill.

\section{Introduction}

Welcome to the future of study rooms! Imagine a place where everything works seamlessly to make your study experience better. That's what our project, the RFID-Based Smart Study Room, is all about.

In traditional study rooms, we often waste time managing things manually, like turning on lights and fans or taking attendance. But with our project, we're bringing automation to the study room to make life easier.

Using RFID technology, we've created a system that knows when you enter the room. As soon as you swipe your RFID card or device, the door opens, and the lights and fan turn on automatically. No more fumbling with switches!

But that's not all. We've also added Bluetooth capability, so you can control the room from your phone or tablet. Want to dim the lights or adjust the fan speed? Just tap a button on your device.

And we're not just making things convenient â€“ we're also saving energy. Our system only activates utilities when someone is in the room, reducing unnecessary power usage and lowering electricity bills.

In short, the RFID-Based Smart Study Room is all about making studying easier, more convenient, and even a little bit futuristic. Say goodbye to manual tasks and hello to a smarter way to study!

\section*{II. Project Overview}

[Problem statement]
Imagine learning  into a study room where everything just works smoothly. That's what this system offers: a hassle-free and efficient way to study. It is like having a personal assistant who keeps track of everything for you.Modern technology has changed how we teach and learn. The RFID-based Smart Studyroom is a cool new idea that uses RFID tags to keep track of students in the study area.

Its main goal is to make study room light fan on off easier and save energy. When students enter the room, they just swipe their RFID cards and the system automatically record it and open the studyroom door. This not only saves time but also helps reduce electricity usage.Overall, the RFID-based Smart Studyroom combines technology with learning to create a better study environment for everyone.$[1]$.

Furthermore, the RFID-based access control feature acts as a strong security precaution in educational environments. It successfully prevents unwanted entrance to Studyrooms, resulting in a safe learning environment. This feature is a 20th invention with real-time information about Studyroom occupancy, allowing them to effectively secure access during study [2].

The centralized database of the system securely saves attendance records and related information. This data warehouse enables complete reporting and analytics capabilities. These capabilities can be used by educators to generate attendance records, track student involvement, and discover attendance trends. Such insights allow for data-driven decisionmaking, which assists educators in improving instructional approaches and tackling attendance-related issues [3].

The RFID-based Smart Classroom Monitoring System takes a revolutionary approach to classroom management by seamlessly integrating RFID technology into educational institutions. Its multiple functions expedite attendance monitoring, strengthen security measures, and give useful data insights, helping educators to promote a more engaging and secure learning environment.
